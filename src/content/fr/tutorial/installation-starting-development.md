## Installation & Starting Development

We'll use yarn ([yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) is a requirement) to create the basic structure of our app:

    yarn create redwood-app ./redwoodblog

You'll have a new directory `redwoodblog` containing several directories and files. Change to that directory and let's create the database, and then start the development server:

    cd redwoodblog
    yarn redwood dev

A browser should automatically open to http://localhost:8910 and you will see the Redwood welcome page:

> Remembering the port number is as easy as counting: 8-9-10!

### First Commit

Now that we have the skeleton of our Redwood app in place, it's a good idea to save the current state of the app as your first commit...just in case.

    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m 'First commit'
